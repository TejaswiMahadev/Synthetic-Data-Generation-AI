# **SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATION USING GENERATIVE AI**
## ðŸ©º Diabetes Synthetic Data Generator (GAN-based)

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to create **realistic synthetic diabetes patient data** using the **Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset** from Kaggle.  
It can be used for **data augmentation**, **privacy-preserving research**, and **health data simulations**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Downloads **Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset** automatically using `kagglehub`.
- Preprocesses the data with **MinMax Scaling** for GAN training.
- Builds a **Generator** and **Discriminator** model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Trains the GAN to generate **realistic synthetic patient records**.
- Post-processes generated data to match:
  - Binary columns (`0`/`1`)
  - Ordinal columns (e.g., Age, Income)
  - Clipped numerical ranges for health metrics (e.g., BMI, Mental Health days).
- Compares **real vs synthetic distributions** using Seaborn.
- Saves clean synthetic dataset as `synthetic_patients_clean.csv`.

## Credit Card Fraud GAN
### ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project compares a real-world credit card fraud dataset from Kaggle with a synthetic dataset generated to mimic its statistical properties.
The goal is to assess how closely the synthetic dataset replicates the distribution, correlations, and fraud characteristics of the real data.

### ðŸ“‚ Datasets
1. **Real Dataset**
- Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection

- Description: Contains 284,807 transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

- Class distribution:
    - Fraudulent transactions: ~0.17% of total.
    - Highly imbalanced dataset.

- Features:
    - 30 columns: Time, V1â€“V28 (PCA components), Amount, and Class (target: 0 = non-fraud, 1 = fraud).

2. **Synthetic Dataset**
- File: improved_synthetic_creditcard.csv
- Description: Artificially generated dataset meant to simulate the statistical characteristics of the real dataset while preserving privacy.
- Purpose: To test whether fraud detection models trained on synthetic data can generalize to real-world cases.

### ðŸ›  Methods Used for Comparison

- Basic Statistical Summary
    - Mean, median, standard deviation for numerical features.
    - Fraud ratio comparison.
- Distribution Analysis
    - Histograms and KDE plots to compare feature distributions.
    - Time and amount distribution comparisons.
- Correlation Analysis
    - Pearson correlation heatmaps for feature relationships.
- Class Imbalance Evaluation
    - Fraud-to-non-fraud ratios.
- Visualization
    - Side-by-side plots for real vs synthetic data.


### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Validate that the synthetic dataset mimics the real dataset's statistical patterns.
- Ensure privacy preservation by avoiding leakage of sensitive real-world information.
- Test fraud detection models on both datasets to check generalization.


### ðŸ“Š Next Steps
- Implement machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).
- Train models on synthetic data and evaluate performance on real data.
- Assess potential domain shift and performance drop.

### ðŸ“œ License
Real dataset: Licensed by the original Kaggle dataset provider.

Synthetic dataset: Publicly shareable (no sensitive data).


# Project Evaluation: Synthetic vs Real Credit Card Fraud Data Comparison
